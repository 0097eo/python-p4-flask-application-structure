# Building Flask Applications

## Learning Goals

- Describe the components of a web application framework.
- Build and run a Flask application on your computer.
- Manipulate and test the structure of a request object.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Web Framework**: software that is designed to support the development of
  web applications. Web frameworks provide built-in tools for generating web
  servers, turning Python objects into HTML, and more.
- **Extension**: a package or module that adds functionality to a Flask
  application that it does not have by default.
- **Request**: an attempt by one machine to contact another over the internet.
- **Client**: an application or machine that accesses services being provided
  by a server through the internet.
- **Web Server**: a combination of software and hardware that uses Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other protocols to respond to requests made
  over the internet.
- **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)**: an interface between web servers
  and applications.
- **Template Engine**: software that takes in strings with tokenized
  values, replacing the tokens with their values as output in a web browser.

## Introduction

It's finally time to create our first Flask application. We'll start this
lesson with your standard "text output in the browser" application, but we'll
also extend a bit further to explore **routing**, creating Flask development
servers, and debugging in the browser.

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment. Then run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in the `lib/` folder.

Instructions begin here:

- Make sure to specify any class, method, variable, module, package names
  that `pytest` will check for.
- Any other instructions go here.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
